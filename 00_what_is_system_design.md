# System Design

**System design** is the process of planning and structuring how a computer system works so it can solve a problem **efficiently, reliably, and at scale**.

**System design** is the process of defining the architecture, interfaces, and data for a system that satisfies specific requirements. System design meets the needs of your business or organization through coherent and efficient systems. It requires a systematic approach to building and engineering systems. A good system design requires us to think about everything, from infrastructure all the way down to the data and how it's stored.

In simple terms, it answers:
> *How should we build this system so it works well now and as it grows?*

## Why is System Design so important?

System design helps us define a solution that meets the business requirements. It is one of the earliest decisions we can make when building a system. Often it is essential to think from a high level as these decisions are very difficult to correct later. It also makes it easier to reason about and manage architectural changes as the system evolves.

## What System Design Includes

System design focuses on the **big picture**, not just writing code.

Key areas:
- **Components** – servers, databases, APIs, services
- **Communication** – how components talk to each other
- **Data storage** – databases, caching, backups
- **Scalability** – handling growth in users or data
- **Reliability** – staying available during failures
- **Performance** – fast response times
- **Security** – protecting data and access

## Example

For a system like **Instagram**, system design would consider:
- Where photos are stored
- How content is delivered quickly to millions of users
- How the system handles server failures
- How likes and comments update in real time

---

## Why System Design Matters (which type of question it answeer)

- Prevents systems from crashing as they grow
- Improves efficiency and reduces costs
- Makes systems easier to maintain and upgrade

---

## Where System Design Is Used

- Software engineering interviews
- Large-scale applications
- Backend and full-stack development

---

## Simple Analogy

System design is like **designing a city**:
- Roads → data flow  
- Buildings → servers  
- Warehouses → databases  
- Traffic rules → communication protocols
