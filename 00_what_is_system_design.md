# System Design

**System design** is the process of planning and structuring how a computer system works so it can solve a problem **efficiently, reliably, and at scale**.

In simple terms, it answers:
> *How should we build this system so it works well now and as it grows?*

## What System Design Includes

System design focuses on the **big picture**, not just writing code.

Key areas:
- **Components** – servers, databases, APIs, services
- **Communication** – how components talk to each other
- **Data storage** – databases, caching, backups
- **Scalability** – handling growth in users or data
- **Reliability** – staying available during failures
- **Performance** – fast response times
- **Security** – protecting data and access

## Example

For a system like **Instagram**, system design would consider:
- Where photos are stored
- How content is delivered quickly to millions of users
- How the system handles server failures
- How likes and comments update in real time

---

## Why System Design Matters

- Prevents systems from crashing as they grow
- Improves efficiency and reduces costs
- Makes systems easier to maintain and upgrade

---

## Where System Design Is Used

- Software engineering interviews
- Large-scale applications
- Backend and full-stack development

---

## Simple Analogy

System design is like **designing a city**:
- Roads → data flow  
- Buildings → servers  
- Warehouses → databases  
- Traffic rules → communication protocols
